Module 9 Challenge Analysis

Overview of the study:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a broad overview of the Oahu, Hawaii temperature trends throughout the months of June and December across many years. 
The study provides us with a generalized temperature for the location in the form of an average, or mean temperature. 
The standard deviation gives us a sense as to how spread out the daily temperatures can be from each other, and so gives us an idea of how much we can expect that average to vary.
We also have the temperatures listed for both the top 75% of all recordings and the lower 25%. These give us an idea of how hot or cold Oahu is at those extremes. The data also provides us with the temperature at the half-way point of our data set. This number which is at the 50% mark of all recorded data is a good comparison to our average, and is a mere fraction different from our average number.  
The statistics allow us to make comparisons to June and December in isolation, as well as comparing the two months to each other as the same statistical data is supplied for each.

Results of the study: 
The results provide us with several points of interest for the possibility of a business venture in Oahu. 

The temperatures in these two months are generally not too different. The averages are only three degrees different, and the averages are reinforced by the median values. It appears temperatures tend to remain fairly stable all year around. In June we see an average temperature of 74.9 degrees, with the median number being 75.0. In December we have an average of 71.04 degrees with the median of 71.0. Four degrees difference between six months of time appears quite consistent.
The standard deviation for the temperatures in both months is also very close. With just over 3 degrees of difference, it appears that generally we donâ€™t see big changes in the warmth in Oahu.
Looking at the entire data set we do see some potential for significant changes in temperature. The minimum temperature is 64 degrees in June and 56 degrees in December. Those are fairly sizable alterations from our average and median numbers, however those are both the extremes that this data set covers. The next lowest statistic is the number at the 25% mark of our data, and both these numbers rest close to our average with only one degree difference in June, and two degrees in December. That can give us confidence that those low temperatures are unusual outliers.


Summary of the study:
The results have shown us that we can consider the temperatures of Oahu to be generally consistent throughout the year, and fluctuations are minimal in both months. Though there are potential for outliers, we see the bulk of the data being very close in range.
In addition to looking at summary temperatures in June and December, it would also be worth while to try to measure water levels and wave activity. This data is meant to help with making an informed decision on opening a surf shop, and the water at the coasts is a key element to drawing people in for that purpose.
